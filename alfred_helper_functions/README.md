This folder contains scripts that are mostly redundant to the ones in the main
directory. These include:

metadata_rare_events.py - this program doesn't work very well. It searches for
all types of rare pairings but it can't differentiate between normal rare
pairings and suspicious ones, and there are a large number of outputs.

check_data_integrity_csv.py - this program adds some functionality by searching
for inconsistent pairings of values between columns

combine_metadata.py - this is an alternative implementation of
out1_renamed_columns.csv and might serve as a useful crosscheck.
